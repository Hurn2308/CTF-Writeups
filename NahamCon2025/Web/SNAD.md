No, it's not a typo. It's not sand. It's SNAD. There's a difference!

# Flag
flag{6ff0c72ad11bf174139e970559d9b5d2}


# Analysis
Needs sand particles in specific positions to achieve the flag, view the script.js to get the information regarding this and you should get the flag by running the code in the console.


# Solution
Run this in console:
```
injectSand(367, 238, 0);
injectSand(412, 293, 40);
injectSand(291, 314, 60);
injectSand(392, 362, 120);
injectSand(454, 319, 240);
injectSand(349, 252, 280);
injectSand(433, 301, 320);
```
