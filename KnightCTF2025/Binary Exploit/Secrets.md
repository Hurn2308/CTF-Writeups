# Flag
`KCTF{_c0ngRaT5_Kn1GHT_Y0U_g07_THE_secreT_}`

# Analysis
This was a pwn challenge but it was more related to pyjail if anything, in the challenge description we are given the person.obj.role as a useable command to get the role of the user.

Using this we can use it to indirectly reference the global information within the server which reveals the key needed to be entered to acquire the flag.
```
Enter your secret: {person_obj.__init__.__globals__}          
Output: {'__name__': '__main__', '__doc__': None, '__package__': None, '__loader__': <_frozen_importlib_external.SourceFileLoader object at 0x7ad8eee278f0>, '__spec__': None, '__annotations__': {}, '__builtins__': <module 'builtins' (built-in)>, '__file__': '/challenge/challenge.py', '__cached__': None, 'CONFIG': {'KEY': '_KNIGHTSECRET2025_'}, 'Person': <class '__main__.Person'>, 'fun': <function fun at 0x7ad8eee0e340>, 'main': <function main at 0x7ad8eebf0d60>}
```


# Solution 
Entering the key gives you the flag:
```
Enter your secret: _KNIGHTSECRET2025_
Congratulations, noble knight! You have unveiled the vault's secret.
Here is your banner of victory: KCTF{_c0ngRaT5_Kn1GHT_Y0U_g07_THE_secreT_}
