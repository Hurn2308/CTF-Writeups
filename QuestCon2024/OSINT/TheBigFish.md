#The Big Fish

Professor has retireved this image which was taken at the time and at the very place of a cyberattack from the dashcam of our suspect's car. Find the organization(1 word) that was attacked and also figure out when. A big amount of money was stolen in this attack. The figure is XX crore rupees. Flag format: QUESTCON{name_of_organization-year_of_attack-XX}

#Solution
The image provided wasn't that helpful when searching through google lens so I used exiftool to see if I could gather any useful information. After using exiftool the image GPS location was identifiable and using the coordinates I found the organization on Google Maps which was cosmos bank. I then just googled "cosmos bank cyber attack" and found an article with the information.

The flag is QUESTCON{cosmos-2018-94}
