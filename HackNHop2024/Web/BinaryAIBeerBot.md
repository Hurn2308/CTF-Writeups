# Solution
Also don't have the image of this website but when you head to the site you will be greeted with an audio file that's weird sounding, reading the challenge description we are instructed to decode the bot's greeting message. Once you get the audio file inspect it using audacity and you can identify or guess by the challenge name that the sounds relate to binary with the lower frequency representing 0 and higher representing 1.

At the double line its lower frequency than single line so we can assume double line is 0 and single line is 1 then extract and get tinyurl link:

Going to the website its a page that turns text into binary and then into .wav file to download that you can use to communicate with the bot.
