Grub Gott - Can't remember the points

For this challenge a file that is named encrypt.cpp was provided. The following is the code that belongs to the file.

I'm not really good at coding or crypto so my initial idea was to ask chatGPT to explain the code of the file to get a rough idea on what's going on. After running the code provided by GPT the initial result I got was an obscured text that could not be deciphered or translated into anything, so I figured I was on the wrong track and tried to read and understand the code more.

After analyzing closely, I realized the cipher was rotating through numbers 1-26 labelled as variable n. Seeing this I decided to ask GPT to write me a script that gives the result through iterating every number from 1-26. After running the script I eventually got a readable word which can be seen below.
