The only file that was provided for the challenge was an image of a station as seen below.

The flag of the challenge is the train lines of the station in the image so once we find out the station we will be able to find the train lines. As with all OSINT challenges related to images the first step is to use google lens to find either the same exact image that may exist online or a similar one. After checking for the image on google, we can see that there is the exact same image in a reddit post.

Upon navigating to the reddit post, the first comment on the post we can see someone identifying the station as Kitakami Station in Japan.

The next step was to google Kitakami Station and navigating to it's wikipedia page that lists all of its train lines.

Then all I had to do was combine all 3 lines into the flag format and try every combination to see which was the right order.
