For this challenge we were once again given an image as seen below.

After searching in google images for the origin of the image we can see it comes from a wikimedia page, this is an old painting done by an Artist in the 1500s.

The flag format was IBOH24{Art-ID}, this is a hint in itself telling you that you need to identify the art id of the painting. 
But as I was not sure where to find it and how to find it I asked chatGPT and gave it the title of the challenge, upon analysis of the title of the challenge and flag format chatGPT suggested it may be asking for the art-id of the painting in the Lost Art Database. So, I navigated to the Lost Art Database and sure enough there was a search function. At first I tried to search the name of the painting itself which was Madonna Col Bambino Incoronata Da Due Angeli but it gave no results.

So, I then searched the artist of the painting itself which is Ambrosius Benson and as can be seen below we have found the lost art with its art ID.
