Lost Art - 300 points

For this challenge we were once again given an image as seen below.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbf3e3d7-e842-4af5-8264-cfa4699b9eee)

After searching in google images for the origin of the image we can see it comes from a wikimedia page, this is an old painting done by an Artist in the 1500s.

The flag format was IBOH24{Art-ID}, this is a hint in itself telling you that you need to identify the art id of the painting. 
But as I was not sure where to find it and how to find it I asked chatGPT and gave it the title of the challenge, upon analysis of the title of the challenge and flag format 
chatGPT suggested it may be asking for the art-id of the painting in the Lost Art Database.
