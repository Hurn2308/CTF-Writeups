This challenge had a short description which was Programmable Idiotic Encryption Tool that had a capatilized P.I.E.T and an image file to download. This challenge honestly felt more like OSINT to me but I get why it's in the misc category. The image was a line of different colours that had various lengths as well unfortunately I can't seem to find the image file so I can't share it here. The first hint for the challenge was the 4 different capatilized letters, combining the letters you get PIET. Not knowing what this was but guessing that it was a hint related to the challenge I googled piet ctf challenge where I found this CTFtime writeup that had a link to a website where you can input and run the PIET image.

Navigate to this website and input the image file into the upload and run the PIET code, you will receive the flag.
