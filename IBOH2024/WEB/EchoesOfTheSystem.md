Echoes of The System - can't remember how many points

Unfortunately I do not have any screenshots as I forgot to take them during the competition so all I can do is explain how to solve it. First I started by investigating each page to see what are exploitable functions or any entry points for injection. When I got to the feedback page I attempted to inject SQL first but it didn't work, after giving it some thought I realized based on the name of the challenge it was probably normal command injection vulnerability so I entered ls into the feedback field. Sure enough there was a response that listed all the files in the current directory, there was a file named flag.txt so this was obviously the target for this challenge. First, I tried to use the "echo flag.txt" command to read out the contents of the file but there was an error where you could not use the word flag in the command with echo. Second, I tried to use cat but cat was also one of the prohibited commands. Lastly, I figured if the issue was the word flag I would change it so I used to command "cp flag.txt test2.txt" to copy the content of the flag.txt file into another file and then "echo test2.txt" to read the file content which was the flag: IBOH24{G3T_DaA8880948_F1aG}
