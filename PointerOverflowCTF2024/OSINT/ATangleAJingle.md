A Tangle A Jingle - 200 points

Description: Sometimes I like to try to find the exact location where a photo was taken. A little OSINT exercise I do sometimes to keep my skills sharp. This image was posted to a social media platform last year. I was able to find where it was taken, and if you can too then you will see that there is a business just out of frame, across the street from the building on the corner, to the left of the bollards. The phone number on their sign is the password to the archive (no spaces or special characters.)

Putting the image provided through google lens after scrolling for a bit we will find a website detailing the closing of a papa john's which is the corner building to the left of the image. After reading through the news site we can see the street the papa john's is located at is Grimsby Road

Using google streetview we can find the same papa john's and locate the building to the left of it across the bollards as instructed in the challenge description.

Going up close to the store we can read the phone number of the store which is 01472600874 and using this phone number we can unzip the zipped file provided in the challenge to get the flag.txt file which has the flag : poctf{uwsp_1_h4v3_4_dr34m}
