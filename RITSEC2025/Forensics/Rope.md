# Description
I overheard some aliens speaking in their native tongue and was roughly able to translate what they were saying. Something about using ropes to get into their scary alien fortress? I dunno...

# Flag
RS{s0rry_1_cu7_d0wn_4_tr33_t0_m4k3_th15_im4g3}


# Analysis
To start since this is a forensics challenge with a fortress.png file provided I checked for the file content.


# Solution
Strings the file to get the flag.
